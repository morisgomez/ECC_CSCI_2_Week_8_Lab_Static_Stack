# ECC_CSCI_2_Week_8_Lab_Static_Stack
Create a Car Parts machine tracker with a Static Stack Class via Arrays and its algorithms. Practice for El Camino College CSCI 2 - Data Structures.

/*
<br>
 Program Name: Static_Stack.cpp
 Programmer: Moris Gomez
 Date: Tuesday 04/03/2024
 Version Control: 4.0
 About: Week 8, CSCI 2, Lab 1.
 Description:
 The maximum number of car parts that can be added to the stack is 10. If the user tries to
 add more than 10 car parts, the program should display an error message and not add the car
 part to the stack. Similarly, if the user tries to remove a car part from an empty stack,
 the program should display an error message and not remove anything.

 Requirements:
 1. Implement the stack using an array of size 10.
 2. Use appropriate error messages to inform the user of any errors.
 3. Use functions to implement each of the operations described above.
 4. Use a menu-driven approach to allow the user to select an operation to perform.

 Example output:

 Welcome to the machine tracking system!
 Please select an option:

 1. Add a machine
 2. Remove a machine
 3. Display the top machine
 4. Display all machines
 5. Quit
